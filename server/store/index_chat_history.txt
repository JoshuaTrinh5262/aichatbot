User: what is WMP ?
Ai:
The World Mosquito Program (WMP) is a not-for-profit group of companies owned by Monash University that works to protect the global community from mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue, Zika, yellow fever and chikungunya. We are committed to strengthening the capacity of local communities around the world to reduce the threat of mosquito-borne diseases. We are expanding our method for low-cost, large-scale application across urban areas in countries affected by mosquito-borne diseases. We are collaborating with local communities, governments and health agencies to implement our self-sustaining Wolbachia method.
User: How does the World Mosquito Program's Wolbachia method work?
Ai:
The World Mosquito Program's Wolbachia method works by introducing Wolbachia into Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary vector of the dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses. We release Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes in areas where these mosquito-borne viruses are endemic. Once our Wolbachia mosquitoes are released, they breed with wild mosquitoes. Over time, the percentage of mosquitoes carrying Wolbachia grows until it remains high without the need for further releases.
User: can you tell me about WMP website ?
Ai:
Yes, the World Mosquito Program (WMP) website provides information about our work to protect the global community from mosquito-borne diseases. It includes information about our Wolbachia method, our projects, our research studies, and our partners. You can also find out how to get involved and support our work.
